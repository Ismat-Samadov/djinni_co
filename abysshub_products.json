For example the file could look like this:www.link1.com/interesting-articlewww.link2.ge/much-more-interesting-articleABOUT: This project is a web scraping and sentiment analysis tool designed to extract articles from online sources and analyze their emotional tone. It starts by taking one or more article URLs as input, which can be provided through an environment variable called urls. If no input is given, it falls back to a default example. The tool uses a built-in web scraper to download the content of each article and save it as a text file. It then processes the text using three sentiment analysis methods: VADER, Naive Bayes, and TextBlob. The results include both a short preview of the article and a breakdown of the sentiment scores. All outputs, including individual analysis files and a summary report, are saved to the output folder. This setup makes it easy to run the tool as a standalone script or deploy it in environments like AbyssHub, where input is passed through environment variables and outputs are collected from a specific folder.",

The project aims to synchronize with Google Chat and Google Meet integration for Graph8's virtual office application. It involves a series of tasks such as debugging Google OAuth 2.0, resolving SSL/TLS issues, and integrating seamless chat and meet functionality based on Google API. It uses the requests library to interact with the Microsoft Graph API and retrieves a list of files, folders, and content pages from the SharePoint site. The data acquired (including name, URL, type, and last modification) are regularly updated and stored in two .csv files. Additionally, the script handles downloading files from SharePoint to the local system, preserving the original SharePoint folders structure for every newly added or updated file. The code heavily relies on Google OAuth 2.0 for user authorization, Netlify Functions for serverless operations, and Firebase for the database aspect of the project. In summary, this script is developed as an essential tool for streamlining collaborative efforts and ensuring up-to-date resources are available from a shared Office 365 SharePoint Directory.",

    "meta_description": "The simplest deposit (or credit) calculator. Waiver: The amount of accrued interest may slightly differ from the real values you get from your bank, because different banks use different methods for calculation (e.g., at which step to apply rounding). It may also depend on local legislation (e.g. the approach fact/fact of 30/360 can be used). The widget calculates the final amount based on the initial amount, the deposit duration, the annual percentage rate, and the compounding. There is also the option for an additional benefit: to receive a monthly schedule in a separate CSV file. As the widget is a really simple calculator, it has limited functionality. For instance, it works only with integer inputs (principal amount, duration, rate). No taxes are calculated. In case you need a robust calculator for business purpose, which consider all the business and legal requirements, it can be developed upon request.",
