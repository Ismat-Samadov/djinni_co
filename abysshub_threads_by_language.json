The widget should allow me to enter these ingredients and generate a list of recipes that I can make, prioritizing those that use most or all of the items. It would be helpful if it could accommodate dietary preferences or restrictions (e.g., low-carb, gluten-free). Providing step-by-step cooking instructions, estimated preparation and cooking times, and nutritional information would enhance the usefulness. An option to save favorite recipes or generate a shopping list for missing ingredients would be a bonus.",

      "meta_description": "As someone who has lived in multiple different countries, one of my struggles has been figuring which medicine I need to get in the country I am in. The reason is that pharmaceutical companies name the same product differently depending on the location. For example, in Russia, when I had irritation in my eyes I would get eye drops called Visine but when I asked for it in Spain they had no clue what I wanted. Turns out that exact same product by the same company is called Vispring in Spain. However, sometimes the issue is not the difference in the name but that such medicine/product simply does not exist in the given country. In those cases I have to ask the pharmacist to read the ingredients of the medicine I need and suggest another one that has the same ingredients, which can be challenging if the pharmacist doesn't speak English. So, I would like an AI Widget that takes two inputs: name of the medicine as you know it and the country where you are looking for it/its alternative. As output it should give one page pdf that gives a brief information about the medicine I am looking for, then: if it exists under a different name then mentions it, along with instruction for use; and if it doesn't then suggests 1 to 3 closest alternatives based on ingredient, along with instructions for use.",

The reason is that pharmaceutical companies name the same product differently depending on the location. For example, in Russia, when I had irritation in my eyes I would get eye drops called Visine but when I asked for it in Spain they had no clue what I wanted. Turns out that exact same product by the same company is called Vispring in Spain. However, sometimes the issue is not the difference in the name but that such medicine/product simply does not exist in the given country. In those cases I have to ask the pharmacist to read the ingredients of the medicine I need and suggest another one that has the same ingredients, which can be challenging if the pharmacist doesn't speak English. So, I would like an AI Widget that takes two inputs: name of the medicine as you know it and the country where you are looking for it/its alternative. As output it should give one page pdf that gives a brief information about the medicine I am looking for, then: if it exists under a different name then mentions it, along with instruction for use; and if it doesn't then suggests 1 to 3 closest alternatives based on ingredient, along with instructions for use.",

The house price is $350,000, and I'm planning to make a down payment of 15%. I need a widget that can calculate my monthly mortgage payments based on different loan terms (15, 20, 30 years) and interest rates (current market rates and a few variations). The widget should allow me to input the loan amount, interest rate, loan term, property tax rate, homeowner's insurance, and any private mortgage insurance (PMI) if applicable. It should also provide an amortization schedule showing how much of each payment goes toward principal and interest over time. An option to include extra payments to see how they affect the loan payoff date and total interest paid would be helpful. The output should be clear, with charts or graphs illustrating payment breakdowns and total costs.",

      "meta_description": "As someone who has lived in multiple different countries, one of my struggles has been figuring which medicine I need to get in the country I am in. The reason is that pharmaceutical companies name the same product differently depending on the location. For example, in Russia, when I had irritation in my eyes I would get eye drops called Visine but when I asked for it in Spain they had no clue what I wanted. Turns out that exact same product by the same company is called Vispring in Spain. However, sometimes the issue is not the difference in the name but that such medicine/product simply does not exist in the given country. In those cases I have to ask the pharmacist to read the ingredients of the medicine I need and suggest another one that has the same ingredients, which can be challenging if the pharmacist doesn't speak English. So, I would like an AI Widget that takes two inputs: name of the medicine as you know it and the country where you are looking for it/its alternative. As output it should give one page pdf that gives a brief information about the medicine I am looking for, then: if it exists under a different name then mentions it, along with instruction for use; and if it doesn't then suggests 1 to 3 closest alternatives based on ingredient, along with instructions for use.",

The reason is that pharmaceutical companies name the same product differently depending on the location. For example, in Russia, when I had irritation in my eyes I would get eye drops called Visine but when I asked for it in Spain they had no clue what I wanted. Turns out that exact same product by the same company is called Vispring in Spain. However, sometimes the issue is not the difference in the name but that such medicine/product simply does not exist in the given country. In those cases I have to ask the pharmacist to read the ingredients of the medicine I need and suggest another one that has the same ingredients, which can be challenging if the pharmacist doesn't speak English. So, I would like an AI Widget that takes two inputs: name of the medicine as you know it and the country where you are looking for it/its alternative. As output it should give one page pdf that gives a brief information about the medicine I am looking for, then: if it exists under a different name then mentions it, along with instruction for use; and if it doesn't then suggests 1 to 3 closest alternatives based on ingredient, along with instructions for use.",

I need a widget that can help me visualize the cumulative impact of these small actions over time. For example, if I save $10 daily, how much will that amount to in 1 year, 5 years, or 10 years, including interest or investment returns? Similarly, if I walk 5,000 steps more each day, how will that affect my health metrics like calories burned or cardiovascular fitness over time? The widget should allow me to input specific actions, set variables like interest rates or calorie burn rates, and then project the outcomes using graphs or charts. Seeing the tangible future benefits will help reinforce my commitment to these habits. The final output should be an engaging and easy-to-understand visualization that I can revisit whenever I need a motivational boost.",

      "meta_description": "As someone who has lived in multiple different countries, one of my struggles has been figuring which medicine I need to get in the country I am in. The reason is that pharmaceutical companies name the same product differently depending on the location. For example, in Russia, when I had irritation in my eyes I would get eye drops called Visine but when I asked for it in Spain they had no clue what I wanted. Turns out that exact same product by the same company is called Vispring in Spain. However, sometimes the issue is not the difference in the name but that such medicine/product simply does not exist in the given country. In those cases I have to ask the pharmacist to read the ingredients of the medicine I need and suggest another one that has the same ingredients, which can be challenging if the pharmacist doesn't speak English. So, I would like an AI Widget that takes two inputs: name of the medicine as you know it and the country where you are looking for it/its alternative. As output it should give one page pdf that gives a brief information about the medicine I am looking for, then: if it exists under a different name then mentions it, along with instruction for use; and if it doesn't then suggests 1 to 3 closest alternatives based on ingredient, along with instructions for use.",

      "meta_description": "As someone who has lived in multiple different countries, one of my struggles has been figuring which medicine I need to get in the country I am in. The reason is that pharmaceutical companies name the same product differently depending on the location. For example, in Russia, when I had irritation in my eyes I would get eye drops called Visine but when I asked for it in Spain they had no clue what I wanted. Turns out that exact same product by the same company is called Vispring in Spain. However, sometimes the issue is not the difference in the name but that such medicine/product simply does not exist in the given country. In those cases I have to ask the pharmacist to read the ingredients of the medicine I need and suggest another one that has the same ingredients, which can be challenging if the pharmacist doesn't speak English. So, I would like an AI Widget that takes two inputs: name of the medicine as you know it and the country where you are looking for it/its alternative. As output it should give one page pdf that gives a brief information about the medicine I am looking for, then: if it exists under a different name then mentions it, along with instruction for use; and if it doesn't then suggests 1 to 3 closest alternatives based on ingredient, along with instructions for use.",

I need a widget that can suggest self-care activities tailored to my current mood and available time. The widget should allow me to input how I'm feeling (e.g., anxious, tired, unmotivated) and how much time I can dedicate (e.g., 15 minutes, 1 hour). It should then provide a randomized list of activities ranging from quick exercises, mindfulness practices, creative outlets, to indulgent treats. Suggestions might include things like \"Take a 20-minute walk in nature,\" \"Try a guided meditation,\" or \"Prepare a healthy smoothie.\" Including instructions or resources on how to perform the activities would be helpful. The goal is to introduce variety and make self-care engaging, helping me manage stress and improve overall well-being.",

The reason is that pharmaceutical companies name the same product differently depending on the location. For example, in Russia, when I had irritation in my eyes I would get eye drops called Visine but when I asked for it in Spain they had no clue what I wanted. Turns out that exact same product by the same company is called Vispring in Spain. However, sometimes the issue is not the difference in the name but that such medicine/product simply does not exist in the given country. In those cases I have to ask the pharmacist to read the ingredients of the medicine I need and suggest another one that has the same ingredients, which can be challenging if the pharmacist doesn't speak English. So, I would like an AI Widget that takes two inputs: name of the medicine as you know it and the country where you are looking for it/its alternative. As output it should give one page pdf that gives a brief information about the medicine I am looking for, then: if it exists under a different name then mentions it, along with instruction for use; and if it doesn't then suggests 1 to 3 closest alternatives based on ingredient, along with instructions for use.",

Ideally, I'd like something that can take in a text or document (like a PDF, Word file, or even pasted text) and then automatically create a set of relevant multiple choice questions based on the content.Here are some features I’d ideally like to have in this app:* The app should be able to understand the context of the content and generate meaningful questions that align with the material.* It would be great if it could generate questions of varying difficulty, from basic recall to more complex, analytical questions.* If the text includes formulas, equations, or mathematical content, generate calculation-based or problem-solving questions. I’ve tried a few tools, but they often lack one or more of these features, or the questions don’t quite capture the essence of the content.

Inputs I'd like to provide include keywords related to the post: \"fitness,\" \"motivation,\" \"sunrise workout,\" \"healthy living,\" and \"inspiration.\" The widget should generate a list of hashtags that are popular but not overly saturated, to maximize visibility. It would be helpful if it could also provide insights into the usage frequency of each hashtag and suggest a mix of broad and niche tags. An output of around 20-30 hashtags, with recommendations on which ones to prioritize, would be ideal.",
